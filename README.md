# Technical-Assessment---PlayMakers

Tech Assessment Instructions:

We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle. Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:
* Size = 512x512
* The only non-transparent pixels are within a circle
* The colours of the badge give a "happy" feeling.

You can also create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.
